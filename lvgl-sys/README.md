# lvgl-sys
Rust raw bindings for LittlevGL library.

## Usage

Build requires environment variables to be set:

- `DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to the directory containing the `lv_conf.h` header file used for configuration of LVGL library.

We recommend the `lv_conf.h` file to be in your project's root directory. If so, the command to build your project would be:
```shell script
$ DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd` cargo build
```
