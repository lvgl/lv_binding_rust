## Usage

Edit your `Cargo.toml` file dependencies with:
```
$ cargo add lvgl
```

The build requires the environment variable bellow to be set:

- `DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to the directory containing the `lv_conf.h` header file used for configuration of LittlevGL library.

We recommend the `lv_conf.h` file to be in your project's root directory. If so, the command to build your project would be:
```shell script
$ DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd` cargo build
```

### Building for embedded environments

We make use of `bindgen` for generating the bindings to LittlevGL at build time. There is a problem in cargo when building
for `no_std`, so we need to use a workaround to build "lvgl-rs". The mainstrem issue in cargo is being tracked at
[rust-lang/cargo#7915](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7915).

```shell
$ DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd` cargo build -Zfeatures=build_dep
```

#### Requirements / Limitations

LittlevGL C libary do allocate memory dynamically and we need to allocate memory on the heap in the Rust side as well
([`Box`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/alloc/boxed/struct.Box.html)).
That is required, so we can safely provide Rust pointers through FFI. For that reason, we do require
[`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/) module to be available.

## Running the demo

[This project contains examples that can run in a desktop simulator.](./examples)

First, make sure to pull `lvgl-rs` submodules:
```shell
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 
```

Then run the `demo` example:

```shell
$ DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd`/examples/include cargo run --example demo
```

## Feature Support

The bindings are still in development. There are many features of LVGL that needs to be exposed by `lvgl-rs`. In
this section you can check what is implemented at the moment.

### Features

List of LVGL features that impacts the library usage in general.
- [x] Displays: We use [`embedded_graphics`](https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics/0.6.2/embedded_graphics/) library to
      draw to the display. You can use `lvgl-rs` with any of the
      [`embedded_graphics` supported displays](https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics/0.6.2/embedded_graphics/#supported-displays).
- [x] Events: You can listen and trigger events in widget objects.
- [x] Styles: You can set styles in any exposed object. We are still missing the possibility of defining base styles.

is missing a feature you want to make use, please send a Pull Request or open an issue.
