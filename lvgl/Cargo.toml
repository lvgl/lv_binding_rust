# Enable the embedded_graphics crate as a backend for graphics and input
# devices. This is the 'legacy' method (supported in LVGL 0.5.2 and below) and
# requires some manual configuration. See the examples directory for usage
# examples, and see the documentation on Display and on input devices.
embedded_graphics = ["embedded-graphics"]

# Enable interop with the lv_drivers project as a graphics and input backend.
# See the documentation on the drivers module, and the sdl example for a
# practical example.
drivers = ["lvgl-sys/drivers"]

# Enable using the alloc crate internally on platforms that support it. Check
# if your platform supports this crate before enabling.
alloc = ["cstr_core/alloc"]

# Sets the LVGL allocator as Rust's global allocator. This places ALL memory in
# LVGL-handled space, and may require growing the memory pool in lv_conf.h
# above the default.
lvgl_alloc = ["alloc"]

# Ignores the DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH environment variable and instead selects the
# LVGL config that comes bundled with the lvgl-sys crate. Useful if you don't
# need any extra features, but the default config is quite conservative.
use-vendored-config = ["lvgl-sys/use-vendored-config"]

# Enables using a custom tick function in Rust for LVGL. See the documentation
# on the timer module for usage notes.
rust_timer = ["lvgl-sys/rust_timer"]

# Enables using a custom tick function supplied in lv_conf.h
custom_timer = ["lvgl-sys/custom_timer"]

# Enables some unstable features. Currently, #![feature(cfg_accessible)] and
# #![feature(error_in_core)] are used.
# This feature will currently allow:
# - Using built-in LVGL fonts other than the default
# - Handling LvErrors/LvResults with error-handling libraries i.e. anyhow
nightly = []

# Disables auto-initializing LVGL.
# !!! WARNING !!!
# Enabling this feature and forgetting to call lvgl::init() before doing
# anything at all with LVGL *will* cause undefined behaviour and probably a
# segault. Only enable this if you're really, seriously, absolutely certain
# that you need it. Unless you're doing something particularly exotic, this is
# *not* needed, nor would it make anything measurably faster.
#
# However, if you're running baremetal or on a platform that ctor doesn't
# support (https://github.com/mmastrac/rust-ctor/blob/master/ctor/src/lib.rs),
# this feature should be enabled. Remember to call lvgl::init() in your main
# function before constructing or using anything LVGL-related.

# This feature is required to use the custom allocator in lvgl (`LV_MEM_CUSTOM=1` in `lv_conf.h`).
